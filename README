This is the website I used for the QR codes on my Core Exhibition posters.

I probably didn't really need to use rails or any fancy web framework to make
this work (haha), but the only free web hosting service I know and have
experience with is heroku and I know rails works on there so this is using
rails.

This thing is really simple, it has two parts: one for TOK and one for EE.
They all belong to the same controller since this may as well be made of
static HTML (not even CSS) pages.

The home page of the TOK part has links to the original source and also the
image on the poster of each object on the poster and also a link to the full
version of the poster. There are also 3 pages for the 3 images.

The EE part only has one page, and it is the bibliography.

All other pages redirect to a YouTube video of Rick Astley singing 'Never
Gonna Give You Up'.
